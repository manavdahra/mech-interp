# Problem statement

Explore neuron superposition by training their absolute value model on functions of multiple variables. Make inputs binary (0/1) and look at the AND and OR of element pairs.

# Motivation and context

I intend to understand what happens when an MLP layer learns to estimate a multi-variable boolean function taking inspirations from "Toy Models of superposition" paper by Anthropic. 
This problem statement was first formally propesed in 200 Concrete Problems In Interpretability. [See this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oOdrQ80jDK-aGn-EVdDt3dg65GhmzrvBWzJ6MUZB8n4/edit)
